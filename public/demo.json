        "description": "ASUS ROG Strix NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 OC Edition 24GB Gaming Graphics Card is buffed-up design with chart-topping thermal performance. This Graphics card is featured with the building blocks whivh is the worldâ€™s fastest, most efficient GPU, the all-new Ampere SM brings 2X the FP32 throughput and improved power efficiency. It Experience 2X the throughput of 1st gen RT Cores, plus concurrent RT and shading for a whole new level of ray tracing performance. The Graphics card is also comes with 3rd Generation Tensor Cores, that get up to 2X the throughput with structural sparsity and advanced AI algorithms such as DLSS. Now with support for up to 8K resolution, these cores deliver a massive boost in game performance and all-new AI capabilities. In this Graphics card, Axial-tech fan design has been optimized for a new, larger heatsink that features more fins and surface area than last gen. Here, The blade count has been increased on all three fans, with 13 on the center fan and 11 on the auxiliary fans. The barrier ring on the side fans has been slimmed down to allow for more lateral intake and to provide better airflow through the cooling array. The center fan's extra blades and full-height ring that provide boosted static pressure to blast air directly onto the GPU heat spreader. In this latest GPU, the heat spreader draws heat up into heatpipes that carry it through a fin stack that fills a large 2.9-slot footprint. Increasing the heatsink size compared to the last generation provides more thermal headroom to account for the new high-performance chipset. In This Graphics card , the Axial-tech Fan Design has been tuned up with more fan blades and a reversed rotational direction for the center fan and also It's 2.9-slot design expands cooling surface area compared to last gen for more thermal headroom than ever before. The exclusive RTX 3090 Asus Graphics has Super Alloy Power II that includes premium alloy chokes, solid polymer capacitors, and an array of high-current power stages and also the GPU Tweak II provides intuitive performance tweaking, thermal controls, and system monitoring. n addition to under-the-hood design changes, the ROG Strix ASUS features a new face with metal accents that mirror the design aesthetic of ROG and ROG Strix motherboards and also mixing surface textures and materials make a statement when vertically mounted and lit by chassis LEDs. For those who prefer a sleeker, more subtle look, the greyscale colorway allows it to seamlessly blend into the build. The latest exclusive ASUS ROG Strix NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 OC Edition 24GB Gaming Graphics Card has 03 years of warranty.",

        "description": "The GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 4080 16GB AERO OC Graphics Card, based on the Ada Lovelace architecture and designed to handle the graphical demands of 8K gaming and high frame rates, brings the power of real-time ray tracing and AI to your PC games. The GPU has 16GB of GDDR6X VRAM and a 256-bit memory interface, which provides better performance and power efficiency than the previous Ampere-based iteration. The front panel of the card features a variety of outputs, such as DisplayPort 1.4a and HDMI 2.1. HDMI 2.1 supports up to 48 Gb/s bandwidth and a range of higher resolutions and refresh rates, including 8K @ 60 fps, 4K @ 120 fps, and even up to 10K. The RTX 4080 is not just about high-resolution gaming. Computationally intensive programs can utilize the GPU's 9728 cores to accelerate tasks using CUDA and other APIs. Gigabyte used the WINDFORCE cooling technology for cooling. The three fans rotate in opposite directions to decrease turbulence and boost airflow pressure. When the GPU is running a low-load or low-power game, the 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans turn off. The triangle fan edge splits the airflow, which is then steered smoothly along the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface. The graphene nano lubricant can extend the life of the fans while also making them quieter. It also has RGB Fusion, which includes color customization and a variety of lighting effects. It can also be used to sync with other AORUS devices. The GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 4080 16GB AERO OC GDDR6X Graphics Card comes with a 02-year warranty.",

        "description": "The ASUS Dual Radeon RX 6600 melds performance and simplicity like no other. It comes with an Axial-tech fan design that features a smaller fan hub that facilitates longer blades and a barrier ring that increases downward air pressure. It features Auto-Extreme Technology and a protective backplate to ensure all-around reliability. It's the perfect combination for a powerful plug-and-play experience. Newly designed for the latest generation of top-end ROG graphics cards, these fans feature a smaller hub that facilitates longer blades and a barrier ring to increase downward air pressure. An advanced onboard controller brings fans to a standstill when the GPU core temperature is below 60 Celsius, letting you enjoy light gaming in relative silence. As temps rise past the threshold, the fans automatically start up again. Dust is enemy number one for fans. It's easy to clean the blades, but taking the fan apart to remove dust that has made its way inside is not a simple task. The PCB is reinforced by an aluminum backplate that adds structural rigidity, helping to prevent flex and protect components and trace pathways from damage. Each card must meet rigorous performance and reliability standards before it ships. Performance and stress tests are run with the latest chart-topping titles like Fortnite, League of Legends, Overwatch, and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. We also carry out reliability trials that include a 144-hour stability test and a series of 3DMark benchmarking runs to ensure the card performs well when pushed to the limits. Experience stutter-free, tear-free gaming with AMD Radeon FreeSync Premium Pro technology, available on many ASUS monitors. The shroud features a subtle illuminated strip that creates a stylish accent for your build. The ASUS GPU Tweak II utility takes graphics card tuning to the next level. It allows you to tweak critical parameters including GPU core clocks, memory frequency, and voltage settings, with the option to monitor everything in real-time through a customizable on-screen display. Advanced fan control is also included along with many more features to help you get the most out of your graphics card. The ASUS Dual Radeon RX 6600 comes with 3 years of warranty.",
